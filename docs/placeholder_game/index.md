# PlaceholderGame

I've been through the course already,
so i've already made a game in :simple-gamemaker: GameMaker Studio.

It's called Placeholder (yes, that's actually the name),
and it's a fun little rouge-like shooter.

It's by no means perfect, and kinda un-optimised 


Now where did I leave the code...
